### Classes:

- Define TypeScript classes (`Shape`, `Square`, `Circle`, `Rectangle`) representing geometric shapes.
- Each class encapsulates properties (side, radius, length, width) and methods (`calculateArea`, `displayArea`) for area calculation and output.

### Inquirer Prompts:

- Use `inquirer.prompt` to interactively ask the user to choose a shape and provide necessary dimensions (side length, radius, length, width).

### Switch Statement:

- Implement a `switch` statement to handle user choices (`sq`, `cr`, `rt`, etc.).
- Depending on the choice, prompt for specific inputs, create an instance of the corresponding shape class, calculate its area, and display the result.

### Validation:

- Validate user inputs (numeric values greater than zero) using validation functions within `inquirer.prompt`.

### Display:

- Output the calculated area of the selected shape using `console.log` and the `displayArea` method defined in each shape class.

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to enhance this CLI tool, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Here are a few ideas for contributions:
- Adding more shapes (e.g., Triangle, Rhombus) with their respective calculations.
- Improving user interface and error handling.
- Enhancing documentation or adding more examples.

```js
git clone 
```
