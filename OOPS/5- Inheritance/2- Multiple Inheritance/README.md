# Multiple Inheritance
Multiple inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. In other words, a subclass can have multiple direct superclasses.

# Key Points about Multiple Inheritance:

- Inheriting from Multiple Classes:
Unlike single inheritance, where a subclass inherits from only one superclass, multiple inheritance allows a subclass to inherit from multiple superclasses.

- Example Scenario:
Consider a class A with methods and properties related to one aspect of functionality, and another class B with methods and properties related to a different aspect. A subclass C can inherit from both A and B, thereby combining functionalities from both parent classes.
