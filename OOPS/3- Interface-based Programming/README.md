# Interface Based Programming with OOP
Using interfaces to define property data types and methods in TypeScript offers several advantages, even if we can specify types directly in the class. Here's why interfaces are beneficial:

1. Separation of Concerns
Interfaces separate the definition of the contract from its implementation. This separation makes the code cleaner and easier to manage. You can define what properties and methods an object should have without worrying about how they are implemented.

2. Reusability
An interface can be reused by multiple classes. This promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy.

# Benifits
Using interfaces in TypeScript provides several benefits:

- Consistency: Ensures that classes follow a specific contract.
- Reusability: Promotes code reuse and modularity.
- Flexibility: Allows for polymorphism and flexible code design.
- Dependency Injection: Supports dependency injection patterns.
- Type Safety: Enables static typing and compile-time checks.
- Documentation: Serves as documentation for your code structure.

# Conslusion
The process of using interfaces to define and enforce contracts in TypeScript, enabling abstraction, polymorphism, decoupling, and dependency injection, is referred to as interface-based programming. This approach is a fundamental aspect of object-oriented programming, promoting better design, maintainability, and flexibility in your code.
