# Anonymous functions
An anonymous function in programming is a function that does not have a name. Instead of being defined with a specific identifier, it is created inline, often as part of another expression or statement. Anonymous functions are useful for situations where a function is needed temporarily or as a callback, and it does not need to be reused elsewhere in the code.

# Characteristics of Anonymous Functions:
- No Name: Anonymous functions do not have an identifier associated with them, unlike named functions.
- Defined Inline: They are typically defined inline where they are needed, rather than being declared separately.
- Flexibility: They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, or returned from other functions.
- Encapsulation: They can capture variables from their surrounding scope, making them useful for closures.
- Short-lived: They are often used for short-lived tasks or as one-time callbacks.

# Syntax in JavaScript/TypeScript:
In JavaScript and TypeScript, there are a few different ways to define anonymous functions:

# Function Expression:

```typescript
const myFunction = function() {
    // Function body
};
```

# Arrow Function Expression:

```typescript
const myFunction = () => {
    // Function body
};
```
