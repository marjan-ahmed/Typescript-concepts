In TypeScript, null is a special value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of the primitive types in JavaScript and TypeScript. Understanding null and its role in TypeScript can help you write more robust and type-safe code. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

# Null in TypeScript
<h3>Primitive Value:</h3>

null is a primitive value that indicates the absence of a value.
It is often used to signify that a variable intentionally does not hold any object.

<h3>Type System:</h3>

TypeScript has a null type, which means that null can be used as a type.
By default, the type null is a subtype of all other types, meaning that you can assign null to any variable unless you use strict null checking.

# Differences Between null and undefined
- null: Represents an intentional absence of any object value. It is a value you can assign to a variable.
- undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
