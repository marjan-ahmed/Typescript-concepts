# Type Literals
Typescript allows you to specify exact values that a variable can hold using type literals. This can be particularly useful when you want to restrict a variable to a specific value or a set of values.

# Example
Imagine you to visit a resturent at 11pm (at night), and that time they have only two dishes **"Biryani"** and **"Palao"**. You can not choose more because there is no option. So you just have to select their specific food.
Similarly in programming, there is also the concept of specification called **"type literals"**
