# Intersection Type

like in Math, we study the intersection in chapter sets. The first set join or concatinates the second set, and the result set is the intersection of the two sets,

<h3>For example:</h3>

A = {2,4,6} <br>
B = {4,5,7} <br>
Aâˆ©B = {2,4}

***In TypeScript, we can do the same using intersection type to intersect two objects***
