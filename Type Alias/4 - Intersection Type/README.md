# Intersection Type

like in Math, we study the intersection in chapter sets. The first set join aur concatinates or join the second set. and the result set is a intersection of the two sets,

<h3>For example:</h3>

A = {2,4,6} <br>
B = {4,5,7} <br>
Aâˆ©B = {2,6}

***In TypeScript, we can do the same using intersection type to intersect two objects***
